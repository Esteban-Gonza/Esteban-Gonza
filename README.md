Hi there ðŸ‘‹

IÂ´m a videogame developer and designer, capable to do labor in level design, sound and effects design, and character design, but more focused on programming and creating mechanics. I perform well and have plenty of experience with languages like C++ and C# and using them on Unreal Engine and Unity in many platforms (PC, Android, IOs). I am good at troubleshooting, finding, and solving problems. I keep learning with every project and want to do it in a great Games company.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my own projects to learn a lot more with each game
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and improving on C# and C++ programming and using it on Unreal Engine and Unity for Mobile and 3D Games.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on videogames projects and get into a company to use my abilities and learn many more.
