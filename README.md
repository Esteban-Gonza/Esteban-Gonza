Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a game developer with extensive experience in various programming languages, such as C#, C++ and JavaScript, Python, Java, etc. I also have extensive experience with development environments and engines such as Unity, Unreal Engine 4 - 5, Love 2D, etc. I also have experience working with agile methodologies (Scrum, XP) that I have used in my university projects and in my previous jobs with various work groups in person and virtually.
I have experience working with groups of programmers and groups from various areas such as art, sound, and modeling.
I am very good at working under pressure and with delivery times.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my own projects to learn a lot more with each game, and working as a game programmer in a video games studio.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and improving on C# and C++ programming, design patterns and algorithms, and using it on Unreal Engine and Unity for Mobile and 3D Games.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on video game projects and get into a company to use my abilities and learn many more.
