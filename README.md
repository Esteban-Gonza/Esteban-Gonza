Hi there ðŸ‘‹

IÂ´m a videogame developer and designer, capable to do labor in level design, sound and effects design, and character design, but more focused on programming and creating mechanics. I perform well and have plenty of experience with languages like C++ and C# and using them on Unreal Engine and Unity. I always deliver the job before the time deadline comes and work well under pressure. I am good at troubleshooting, finding, and solving problems. I do not have much experience but a lot of knowledge and skills ready to be used. I am ready to start working as soon as you need.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my own projects to learn a lot more with each game
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and improving on C++ programming and using it on Unreal Engine
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on videogames projects
