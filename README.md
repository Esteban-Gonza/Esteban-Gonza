Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a developer focused on programming and game design, with experience using game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine, and their respective programming languages: C# and C++, in which I have years of development experience. I also have skills in other languages like Java and JavaScript, and I have experience in database management, including MySQL and Oracle Apex20.
For the past 4 years, I have worked as an independent game developer under my brand, Unlocked Games Studios. I have released a variety of games, mostly developed using the Unity engine and C#. Most of these projects I have developed on my own, although I have also collaborated in various workgroups.
Two years ago, I began working as a freelance developer on the Upwork platform, where I have developed games for various platforms and contracts. My work has involved bug resolution and the implementation of new mechanics.
Recently, I had the opportunity to be part of a professional game development studio, where I further honed my skills as a game developer.
